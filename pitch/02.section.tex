\begin{frame}[fragile]{Quadratic-Programming Solver}
  We have used the \emph{cvxopt} Python library in order to obtain the 
  solutions for our Quadratic-Programming problem.
  \vspace{.5cm}

  This library solve a problem in the form
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
      \min_{x}\ &\ \ \frac{1}{2} x^T P x + q^T x \\
          s.t.\ &\ \ Gx \leq h \\
              \ &\ \ Ax = b
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  \vspace{.5cm}

  So we've ended up in adapting our $max_{x}\ L_D$ problem to the above formulation
  in order to find $\alpha_i$ solutions (look at the code for more details).
